<p><strong>GOLDMAN SACHS (Summer Intern)</strong> <br />
Goldman Sachs’ summer intern program recruits pre final year students as summer interns after a rigorous interview process. I could do an individual project in my time as an intern here. I was introduced to finance concepts, backend web development and a bit of frontend development. Apart from that, I could garner an experience of working with a global (London, New York and Bangalore) corporate team on a real time application</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Develop a system for Client Configuration</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I had to create APIs and then a webpage that would use those APIs to perform CRUD operations on JSON documents called client configurations which were stored in a MongoDb database</li>
      <li>Backend- Endpoints which were essentially RESTful APIs were developed using Java, on the Dropwizard framework, UNIT tests were also written using JUnit to ensure maximum code coverage</li>
      <li>Frontend- was created using AngularJS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>COEP’s Satellite Initiative (Onboard Computer Subsystem)</strong><br />
COEP’s satellite initiative i.e. CSAT has successfully completed the launch and mission objectives of its first satellite SWAYAM and is currently working on the second mission COEPSAT2(CSAT-2). Follow the link for more information: <a href="http://www.coep.org.in/csat/">www.coep.org.in/csat/</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PID Algorithm Implementation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>PID is an error-based correction algorithm, a PID control is implemented in our satellite to regulate the current supplied to a reaction wheel and hence the orientation of the satellite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Nested Vector Interrupt Controller</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Configured its NVIC system to define different interrupts and write Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) for them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ACADEMIC PROJECTS</strong><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pedestrian detection and direction prediction using Video Processing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The system used input videos of pedestrian and employed 3 disparate approaches to detect and predict the motion of a pedestrian using the input video</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Digit Recognition System using Machine Learning</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A sample dataset of handwritten digits was used to develop a model that identifies handwritten digits from their images</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Counting the number of coins in an image using Image Processing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Different image processing techniques were used to perform region segmentation and hence identify the coins and calculate their size from an image of coins</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Flight Reservation System</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Object Oriented Programming and file handling was used to create a domestic plus international flight booking system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rotation of Solar Panels for maximum utilization of sunlight</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A system with a sensor, a microcontroller and an actuator, the direction of the sunlight is observed, and the solar panels are rotated accordingly for maximum utilization of available sunlight</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
