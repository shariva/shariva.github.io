My Main interests lie in Computer Vision, Image Processing, Video Processing and Machine Learning. Follow this link to know about my [Projects and Work Experience](/). Also see [Courses](/courses) for an overview of courses and course projects.

I was an intern at [Goldman Sachs]() in Summer 2020 where I had the opportunity to explore and implement a real time product based project. It mainly involved backend web development. I have also been a part of the [COEP Satellite Team]() where I could learn about different microcontrollers and algortihms.
