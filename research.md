### Research Projects
**GOLDMAN SACHS (Summer Intern)** <br>
Goldman Sachs’ summer intern program recruits pre final year students as summer interns after a rigorous interview process. I could do an individual project in my time as an intern here. I was introduced to finance concepts, backend web development and a bit of frontend development. Apart from that, I could garner an experience of working with a global (London, New York and Bangalore) corporate team on a real time application
- Develop a system for Client Configuration
    - I had to create APIs and then a webpage that would use those APIs to perform CRUD operations on JSON documents called client configurations which were stored in a MongoDb database
    -	Backend- Endpoints which were essentially RESTful APIs were developed using Java, on the Dropwizard framework, UNIT tests were also written using JUnit to ensure maximum code coverage
    -	Frontend- was created using AngularJS

**COEP’s Satellite Initiative (Onboard Computer Subsystem)**<br>
COEP’s satellite initiative i.e. CSAT has successfully completed the launch and mission objectives of its first satellite SWAYAM and is currently working on the second mission COEPSAT2(CSAT-2). Follow the link for more information: http://www.coep.org.in/csat/ 
-	PID Algorithm Implementation
    -	PID is an error-based correction algorithm, a PID control is implemented in our satellite to regulate the current supplied to a reaction wheel and hence the orientation of the satellite
-	Nested Vector Interrupt Controller
    -	Configured its NVIC system to define different interrupts and write Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) for them

**ACADEMIC PROJECTS**<br>
-	Pedestrian detection and direction prediction using Video Processing 
    -	The system used input videos of pedestrian and employed 3 disparate approaches to detect and predict the motion of a pedestrian using the input video
-	Digit Recognition System using Machine Learning
    -	A sample dataset of handwritten digits was used to develop a model that identifies handwritten digits from their images
-	Counting the number of coins in an image using Image Processing
    -	Different image processing techniques were used to perform region segmentation and hence identify the coins and calculate their size from an image of coins
-	Flight Reservation System
    -	Object Oriented Programming and file handling was used to create a domestic plus international flight booking system
-	Rotation of Solar Panels for maximum utilization of sunlight
    -	A system with a sensor, a microcontroller and an actuator, the direction of the sunlight is observed, and the solar panels are rotated accordingly for maximum utilization of available sunlight
